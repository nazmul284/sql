Sure! Here are some SQL queries categorized by beginner, medium, and advanced levels. Each query is provided in a "readme.md" format along with a brief explanation. Remember that these are just examples, and you can modify them based on your database structure and requirements.

## Beginner Queries

### Query 1: Select All Columns from a Table
Retrieve all records and columns from the "Customers" table.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

### Query 2: Filtering with WHERE
Retrieve customers from the "Customers" table who are located in "New York."
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'New York';
```

## Medium Queries

### Query 3: Aggregate Function - Count
Count the number of orders placed by each customer.
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID) AS OrderCount FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID;
```

### Query 4: Joining Tables
Retrieve customer names and their corresponding order details.
```sql
SELECT c.CustomerName, o.OrderDate, o.TotalAmount
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;
```

## Advanced Queries

### Query 5: Subquery - IN
Retrieve customers who have placed orders with a total amount greater than the average order amount.
```sql
SELECT CustomerName
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID
    FROM Orders
    WHERE TotalAmount > (
        SELECT AVG(TotalAmount) FROM Orders
    )
);
```

### Query 6: Common Table Expression (CTE)
Create a CTE to calculate the total sales for each product category.
```sql
WITH CategorySales AS (
    SELECT Category, SUM(Price * Quantity) AS TotalSales
    FROM Products
    JOIN OrderDetails ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
    GROUP BY Category
)
SELECT Category, TotalSales
FROM CategorySales
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

These example queries cover a range of concepts from beginner to advanced levels. Feel free to experiment with them and adapt them to your specific database schema and requirements. As you become more comfortable with SQL, you can explore more complex queries and scenarios.




Certainly! Here are a few more example SQL queries for different levels of expertise:

## Beginner Queries

### Query 7: Sorting Results
Retrieve the names of customers from the "Customers" table, sorted alphabetically by their last names.
```sql
SELECT CustomerName FROM Customers ORDER BY LastName;
```

### Query 8: Filtering with LIKE
Retrieve products from the "Products" table with names containing the word "apple."
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName LIKE '%apple%';
```

## Medium Queries

### Query 9: Subquery - EXISTS
Retrieve customers who have placed at least one order.
```sql
SELECT CustomerName FROM Customers WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
);
```

### Query 10: Aggregate Function - AVG
Calculate the average price of products in each category.
```sql
SELECT Category, AVG(Price) AS AvgPrice FROM Products GROUP BY Category;
```

## Advanced Queries

### Query 11: Self Join
Find employees who have the same manager as another employee.
```sql
SELECT e1.EmployeeName, e2.EmployeeName AS Manager
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID
WHERE e1.EmployeeID != e2.EmployeeID;
```

### Query 12: Window Function - ROW_NUMBER()
Rank customers based on their total order amounts.
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, TotalAmount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TotalAmount DESC) AS Rank
FROM (
    SELECT c.CustomerName, SUM(od.Quantity * p.Price) AS TotalAmount
    FROM Customers c
    JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
    JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
    GROUP BY c.CustomerName
) AS CustomerOrderAmounts;
```

Feel free to explore and modify these queries to match your database structure and specific requirements. As you delve deeper into SQL, you'll find that there are numerous ways to accomplish different tasks, and you can get creative with combining various concepts to achieve your desired results.
